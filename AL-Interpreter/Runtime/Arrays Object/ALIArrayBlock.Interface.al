// ALI Array Block — storage contract for one interpreter array instance, backed by a native
// AL array of Variant (ArrayNativeBlockPlan.md). One implementing codeunit per fixed tier
// (S/M/L), each carrying an `array[Cap] of Variant`. "ALI Interpreter" (array block bank) owns the instances
// (List of [Interface], handle = 1-based index) and picks the tier by TotalN; nothing else
// touches a block directly.

    // EMPTY, not typed-zero — Seed must be filled or reads of untouched cells return an empty

    // would silently hand back the type's default).
