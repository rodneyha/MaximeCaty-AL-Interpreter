// Kept in the MAIN app (not the test app) so "ALI Rec Meta" can resolve its metadata via
// the virtual Field table at bind time and the interpreter can Open a RecordRef on it. The
// tests exercise CRUD, filters, FindSet/Next iteration and typed field access against this
// table using the native-comparison trick (run the same logic through a native Record and
// compare). Fields span the primitive register classes the field opcodes cover.
